# Phase 18 – Polish & Documentation

## Objective
Finalize user-facing and contributor-facing materials, refine UI/UX details, and ensure the application communicates the entire book-creation workflow clearly to new adopters.

## Scope & Context
- Occurs after core functionality, QA, observability, performance, and security enhancements are in place.
- Focuses on smoothing rough edges, clarifying messaging, and packaging knowledge for future maintainers.
- Bridges the gap between technical implementation and user comprehension of the seven-stage pipeline.

## Key Deliverables
- Updated product copy, tooltips, and onboarding flows across UI stages (library dashboard, idea intake, structure lab, title hub, research dashboard, story weave, writing studio).
- Comprehensive documentation set: contributor guide, API references, schema glossary, runbooks, and user manual explaining each phase of the workflow.
- Visual artifacts: architecture diagrams, workflow charts, and optional walkthrough videos/gifs.
- Accessibility audit and fixes ensuring inclusive design for authors and researchers.

## Milestones & Tasks
1. Review UI for consistency in terminology, icons, and status indicators across all stages and the library dashboard.
2. Compile documentation in `docs/`, linking Phase 0–17 outputs and adding quick-start guides.
3. Record or capture step-by-step walkthrough demonstrating project creation through final manuscript export.
4. Conduct accessibility testing (keyboard navigation, contrast, screen reader cues) and address findings.
5. Prepare release notes summarizing key features and known limitations ahead of launch.

## Dependencies
- Completed functional stages (Phases 5–13) and supporting infrastructure (Phases 1–17).
- Documentation contributions from earlier phases to aggregate and refine.

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk**: Documentation lags behind feature updates.
  - *Mitigation*: Integrate doc review into definition of done for remaining tickets; schedule documentation freeze before Phase 19.
- **Risk**: UI polish work introduces regressions.
  - *Mitigation*: Re-run QA suite (Phase 14) after UI tweaks.

## Exit Criteria
- Documentation repository reviewed and approved by technical and product stakeholders.
- UI refinements deployed, passing accessibility checklist and smoke tests.
- Release notes ready for Phase 19 distribution.

## Handoffs & Next Steps
- Supply polished assets to Phase 19 for pre-launch validation and marketing prep.
- Maintain documentation changelog for post-launch iterations (Phase 20 roadmap).
