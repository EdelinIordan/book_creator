# Phase 20 â€“ Launch & Iteration Plan

## Objective
Release the v1 local-first AI book creation platform, monitor early usage, and establish a roadmap for continuous improvement based on user feedback and strategic goals.

## Scope & Context
- Follows successful pre-launch validation, turning the project into a maintained product.
- Includes coordinating release communications, monitoring adoption, and prioritizing enhancements (e.g., collaboration, multilingual support, publishing integrations).
- Emphasizes operational readiness for supporting users through the end-to-end workflow.

## Key Deliverables
- Public release package (Docker images, compose files, documentation, changelog) and announcement materials highlighting the category-based library experience.
- Post-launch monitoring plan covering success metrics from Phase 0 (completion rate, structure satisfaction, cost per book, etc.).
- Feedback channels (issue tracker templates, community forums) and triage process.
- Iteration roadmap outlining near-term improvements and longer-term innovations.

## Milestones & Tasks
1. Finalize release versioning, tag repository, and publish Docker images/bundles.
2. Deploy documentation site or README updates guiding new users through setup and workflow overview.
3. Monitor initial projects, collecting telemetry and direct feedback to detect pain points quickly, paying special attention to library usability and progress tracking accuracy.
4. Hold post-launch retrospective identifying successes, gaps, and priority action items.
5. Update roadmap backlog with categorized enhancements (usability tweaks, feature expansions, infrastructure upgrades).

## Dependencies
- Completion of Phase 19 validation with launch approval.
- Observability (Phase 15) and performance controls (Phase 16) active for real usage monitoring.
- Documentation and support materials from Phase 18.

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk**: Unexpected user issues during launch window.
  - *Mitigation*: Maintain on-call rotation, prepare rollback instructions, and communicate known issues transparently.
- **Risk**: Scope creep delays post-launch stabilization.
  - *Mitigation*: Enforce prioritization discipline; separate urgent fixes from feature requests.

## Exit Criteria
- v1 released publicly with accessible setup instructions and support resources.
- Monitoring indicates stable usage, or issues are being triaged/resolved promptly.
- Roadmap for next release cycle approved, aligning with strategic goals.

## Handoffs & Next Steps
- Continue iterative development cycles, revisiting roadmap regularly.
- Evaluate feasibility of advanced capabilities (collaboration, cloud sync, publisher exports, enhanced portfolio analytics) based on user demand.
