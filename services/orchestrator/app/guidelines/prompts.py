GUIDELINES_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """
You are the creative director orchestrating guideline hand-offs for a nonfiction writing team.
Always return valid JSON that matches the provided schema. Do not fabricate facts or citations.
Keep guidance concise enough for working writers, while covering all required beats.
""".strip()


GUIDELINES_PROPOSAL_PROMPT = """
Act as G1: Assistant Creative Director.

Inputs:
- Project ID: {project_id}
- Book title: {title}
- Synopsis: {synopsis}
- Persona and tone cues (JSON): {persona_json}
- User preferences for guidelines: {preferences}
- Book structure JSON: {structure_json}
- Research facts grouped by subchapter (JSON): {facts_json}
- Emotional layer entries (JSON): {emotional_json}

Tasks:
1. Produce a guideline packet for every subchapter that appears in the structure. Never invent additional IDs.
2. Each packet must include:
   - `objectives`: top outcomes for the draft (2-4 items)
   - `must_include_facts`: objects referencing provided fact IDs with summaries and citations
   - `emotional_beats`: 1-2 cues tying the persona stories to the facts
   - `narrative_voice`: short description aligning persona voice with the subchapter intent
   - `structural_reminders`: callbacks or foreshadowing notes referencing other subchapters when helpful
   - `success_metrics`: checklist items the critic can use to confirm coverage
   - Optional `risks` only when a likely pitfall exists
3. Set `created_by` to "creative_director_assistant", `status` to "draft", and `version` to 1.
4. Include a batch-level `summary` capturing the overarching writing playbook.

Return JSON that matches the `CreativeGuidelineBatch` schema. Do not emit commentary or markdown.

GUIDELINES_CRITIQUE_PROMPT = """
Act as G2: Critic Creative Director.

Here is the draft guideline batch JSON:
{batch_json}

Deliver a bullet list (plain text) that covers:
- Coverage gaps (missing subchapters, absent fact tie-ins, weak objectives)
- Tone or voice misalignment with the persona and synopsis
- Structural issues (missing callbacks, pacing problems, redundant beats)
- Risk checks (overclaiming, citation mismatches, empathy gaps)

Focus on actionable feedback that G3 can apply. Avoid JSON.

- Research facts JSON: {facts_json}
- Emotional layer JSON: {emotional_json}
- Critic feedback:
